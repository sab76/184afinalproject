## Abstract
Ribonucleic acid (RNA) plays a pivotal role in biological functions, providing a key avenue for manipulating cellular processes and advancing medical breakthroughs. Predicting RNA structure provides immense potential in revolutionizing medicine. Harnessing it for biotechnological solutions allows us to treat the worst of human diseases like cancer, troubleshoot brain ailments such as Alzheimer's, and develop antibiotic and antiviral drugs such as the COVID mRNA vaccine. This paper investigates leveraging data science and machine learning techniques to forecast RNA folding patterns by predicting its chemical reactivity.

In this repository you can find some of our experiments on positional encoding methods.
